Generating Woocommerce variations made easy. The missing interface to create and manage stock and pricing for all your product variations.

== Description ==
####EASILY CREATE AND MANAGE WOOCOMMERCE VARIATIONS!####

Variations generator & Mass edit for Woocommerce is the only tool that allows shop managers to instantly create and manage all the variations associated to a product's attributes.

It was made for stores with variable products that have LOTS of variations that require tweaking prices and stocks (like booking activities, travel agencies, highly customizable products like jewels, clothes and many more...)

Now you can mass edit your variations settings by selecting a specific attribute value without the need to edit each variation one by one!	

With this free module you'll be able to :

* Generate your variations based on product's attributes. You can alter variations prices depending on attributes values.
* Bulk edit stock and price of variations matching one or more attribute values.

You will no longer have to use the un-user-friendly default "Variations" tab to manage your variations!

This new module is actively developed and we would love to hear about your user case and experience!

####WVG IN A NUTSHELL####
* Generate all your product variations in a single click
* Easily bulk edit variations based on attribute values
* Mass edit product combinations
* Manager for product variation
